    <h1>Java Source Code Dependency Analyzer Features</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Class-Level Dependency Analysis</h2>
        <p>It examines Java source files to identify class-level dependencies, including inheritance (via <code>extends</code> and <code>implements</code>) and associations between classes. This feature helps in understanding how classes are interrelated, which is crucial for assessing the impact of changes, refactoring, and understanding the overall architecture of the software.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Method Call Hierarchy Extraction</h2>
        <p>The tool can extract the call hierarchy of specific methods, showing which methods are called by a given method (directly and indirectly). This is valuable for debugging, optimizing performance, and better understanding the runtime behavior of applications.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Comprehensive Code Analysis</h2>
        <p>Beyond just identifying dependencies and call hierarchies, the analyzer provides insights into the structural and behavioral aspects of Java applications. This comprehensive analysis aids in identifying potential code smells, improving code quality, and ensuring codebase maintainability.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Export to YAML</h2>
        <p>Analysis results can be exported to YAML files, offering a human-readable format for class dependencies and method call hierarchies. This feature facilitates documentation, reporting, and sharing of analysis results with team members or integrating into documentation sites.</p>
